## Todo
* Create versions that can run on azure notebooks
  * use zip from this repo
  * install scikit, tensorflow, and keras in initial step
* Create steps
  * 0: load and prepeare all images (install and download for azure as well)
* Plot a sample of images and see which ones could not be recognized
  * for both test and training data
* Properly evaluate test data in final version
  * how does training data do?
  * and how test data?
